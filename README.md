# Digital Humanities MSc: POS-tagging lesson
A [lesson on part-of-speech tagging](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bea-alex/DH-MSc-POStagging-lesson/blob/master/POStagging.html) using the collection [A Medical History of British India](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/a-medical-history-of-british-india/) provided by the National Library of Scotland's [Data Foundry](https://data.nls.uk) as an example.

This lesson was created by [Beatrice Alex](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-beatrice-alex) using materials from the Library Carpentries lesson on [Text and Data Mining](http://librarycarpentry.org/lc-tdm/) (under development). [Anouk Lang](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/anouk-lang) provided valuable feedback and input to the lesson to make the descriptions and code more understandable to students without any prior coding experience.
